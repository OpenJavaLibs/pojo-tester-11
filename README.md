**POJO TESTER**

Pojo Tester is a powerful and lightweight open-source Java library designed to simplify the process of testing Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). It helps developers automate the validation of Java objects by verifying common scenarios such as constructors, getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods. The library ensures that POJOs adhere to standard conventions, providing a quick way to perform basic checks without the need for extensive test cases.

The original version of Pojo Tester was created by the author of Pojo.pl, which is a fantastic tool that helped the Java community with POJO validation. However, the original version was not fully updated to support newer Java versions like Java 21. This project, part of the OpenJavaLibs initiative, aims to continue the work by updating and maintaining the library to ensure it works seamlessly with Java 21 and beyond.

By reducing the boilerplate code associated with manual POJO validation, Pojo Tester offers an efficient and scalable solution for software developers, making it easier to maintain and test Java classes with minimal effort. Whether you are working on small projects or large enterprise applications, Pojo Tester provides the necessary tools to ensure your POJOs are consistent, correctly implemented, and ready for use.

Note: The original author of Pojo Tester is credited at Pojo.pl, and the source code can be found at the original GitHub repository.
